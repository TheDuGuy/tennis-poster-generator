# 🎾 Hero-Style Events Calendar - Designer Quality!

## 🎨 What Makes This "WOW"

I've created a **professional designer-quality** events calendar that matches the elegance of your existing Marden Tennis Club materials!

### Design Features:

**✨ Split Hero Layout (Landscape A4)**
- **Left Side:** Large logo + bold "Upcoming Events" title + year
- **Right Side:** Timeline-style event list with date circles

**🎨 Your Actual Branding**
- Deep green background (#3E5F4F) - from your logo
- Peach/beige typography (#E8C4A8) - matches your materials
- White accents for contrast
- Your actual circular Marden Tennis Club logo

**🎾 Tennis Ball Graphics**
- Decorative tennis balls with court line patterns
- Dotted line accents
- Positioned artistically (not just corners!)
- Opacity variations for depth

**📅 Timeline Event Layout**
- Circular date badges with month abbreviations
- Clean vertical timeline with connecting lines
- Tournament events get highlighted with tennis ball yellow (#D0E04D)
- Regular events get peach circles
- Time and title clearly displayed

**⚡ Visual Polish**
- Subtle court line accents top/bottom
- Professional spacing and hierarchy
- Elegant Montserrat font (your brand font)
- Shadow effects for depth
- Landscape format uses space beautifully

## 🚀 How to Use

### Access:
**URL:** http://localhost:3000/posters/events-hero

Or from home page: **"✨ Events Calendar - Hero Style"** (first option, marked RECOMMENDED)

### Adding Events:
1. **Set Year** (e.g., 2025)
2. **Set Month** (used for organizing, but each event can be different month if needed)
3. **Click Days** in the mini calendar
4. **Add Events** with:
   - Time (e.g., "10-12")
   - Title (e.g., "American Tournament")
   - Type:
     - **Tournament** = Gets tennis ball yellow highlight + larger text
     - Social = Regular styling
     - Meeting = Regular styling
     - Training = Regular styling
5. **Add Website** (appears in white box at bottom left)

### Design Tips:

**Event Types:**
- Mark **tournaments** as "Tournament" type - they get prominent yellow circles
- Mark everything else as "Social", "Meeting", etc. - they get peach circles

**Event Titles:**
- Keep concise: "American Tournament" not "American Tournament Event"
- Use proper case: "Open Morning" not "OPEN MORNING"
- BBQ note can go in title: "American Tournament (BBQ)"

**Times:**
- Use format like "10-12" or "10.30-12.30"
- Or "from 19.30" for evening events
